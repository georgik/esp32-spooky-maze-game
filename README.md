## Development

Following steps are useful for IDE integration, so that IDE can recognize which is your current target and fature set.

Check `target` configurad in the file `.cargo/config.toml`.
It should be one of following values:
```
target = "xtensa-esp32-none-elf"
target = "xtensa-esp32s2-none-elf"
target = "xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf"
target = "riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf"
```

If no value is selected, make sure to specify target on command line.

Check default `features` in `Cargo.toml`. Make sure that default set contains your board and display combinations.

If no value is selected, make sure to specify features on command line.
